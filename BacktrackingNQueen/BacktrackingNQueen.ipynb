    "\n",
    "### Formulation\n",
    "The formulation for this implementation of the n-queen problem was the second formulation discussed in class. That is, each variable is the column position of the queen belonging to that row and the domain of each variable is the set of column positions on the n x n chess board.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coordinate System\n",
    "The coordinate system for the chess board was implemented such that the ordered pair (0,0) is the top left corner\n",
    "This implies the following:\n",
    "* The n-th column of the first row is the ordered pair (0,n-1)\n",
    "* The n-th row of the first column is the ordered pair (n-1,0)\n",
    "* The n-th row of the n-th column is the ordered pair (n-1,n-1)\n",
